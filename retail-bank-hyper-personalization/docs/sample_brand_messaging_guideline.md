## Introduction

Welcome to the Brand Messaging Guidelines for our Hong Kong Retail Bank. This comprehensive document is designed to ensure consistency, clarity, and effectiveness in all our communications, both internal and external. As we navigate the complex and dynamic banking landscape of Hong Kong, it is crucial that our brand voice remains unified and strong across all touchpoints.

These guidelines are not just a set of rules, but a reflection of our bank's values, mission, and commitment to our customers. They are designed to empower every employee to become a brand ambassador, capable of conveying our message with confidence and precision.

As you go through this document, remember that our brand is more than just a logo or a tagline. It's the promise we make to our customers every day, the trust we build, and the relationships we nurture. By adhering to these guidelines, we ensure that every interaction reinforces our brand identity and strengthens our position in the Hong Kong banking sector.

Let's dive into the details that will help us communicate our brand effectively and consistently.

## Brand Foundation

Our brand foundation is the bedrock upon which all our communications are built. It encompasses our mission, vision, values, and the essence of who we are as a financial institution.

### Mission and Vision

Our mission is to empower the people of Hong Kong to achieve financial success through innovative banking solutions and personalized service. We envision a future where financial well-being is accessible to all, and where our bank is the trusted partner in every customer's financial journey.

### Core Values

Our core values guide every decision we make and every interaction we have:

1. Integrity: We operate with honesty and transparency in all our dealings.
2. Innovation: We continuously seek new ways to improve our services and meet evolving customer needs.
3. Customer-Centricity: Our customers are at the heart of everything we do.
4. Excellence: We strive for the highest standards in our products, services, and customer experiences.
5. Community: We are committed to contributing positively to the Hong Kong community.

### Brand Personality and Tone of Voice

Our brand personality is professional yet approachable, innovative yet trustworthy. When communicating, we should aim to be:

- Clear and concise: We use simple language to explain complex financial concepts.
- Empathetic: We understand and address our customers' concerns and aspirations.
- Confident: We speak with authority on financial matters.
- Forward-thinking: We demonstrate our innovative approach to banking.

Our tone of voice should be:

- Friendly but not casual
- Informative but not overwhelming
- Reassuring but not patronizing
- Professional but not stuffy

### Target Audience

Our primary target audiences include:

1. Young professionals (25-40 years old)
2. Established career individuals (40-55 years old)
3. Retirees and pre-retirees (55+ years old)
4. Small and medium-sized enterprise (SME) owners

Each segment has unique needs and preferences, which should be reflected in our targeted communications.

### Brand Positioning

We position ourselves as the innovative, customer-centric bank that combines the stability of traditional banking with the convenience of modern digital solutions. Our unique selling proposition is our ability to offer personalized financial guidance supported by cutting-edge technology.

## Language Considerations

As a bank operating in Hong Kong, we must be mindful of the linguistic diversity of our audience and the importance of clear communication in financial matters.

### Bilingual Guidelines

All external communications should be available in both English and Traditional Chinese. The content should be culturally appropriate and not merely a direct translation. Employ professional translators who understand banking terminology and can convey the nuances of our message accurately in both languages.

### Cultural Sensitivity

Be aware of local customs, traditions, and sensitivities when crafting messages. Avoid idioms or expressions that may not translate well across cultures. When in doubt, opt for clear, straightforward language.

### Financial Terminology

Use standardized financial terms consistently across all communications. Provide clear explanations or glossaries when introducing complex financial concepts. Remember that what may be common knowledge to us might be new to our customers.

### Tone Variations

While maintaining our overall brand voice, slight variations in tone are appropriate for different channels:

- Social media: More conversational, but still professional
- Official documents: Formal and precise
- Customer service: Empathetic and solution-oriented
- Marketing materials: Engaging and benefit-focused

## Visual Identity

Our visual identity is a crucial component of our brand messaging. It should be consistent across all platforms to ensure instant recognition and reinforce our brand values.

### Logo Usage

Our logo is the visual cornerstone of our brand. Use it consistently and prominently, following these guidelines:

- Always use the approved logo files
- Maintain the minimum clear space around the logo
- Never alter the logo's colors, proportions, or orientation
- Use the appropriate version (full color, monochrome, or reverse) based on the background

### Color Palette

Our primary colors are:

- Deep Blue (HEX: #003366): Represents trust and stability
- Vibrant Green (HEX: #00A86B): Symbolizes growth and innovation

Secondary colors should complement these and be used sparingly for accents or to highlight important information.

### Typography

Our primary typeface is [Font Name] for headings and [Font Name] for body text. These fonts should be used consistently across all digital and print materials. When these fonts are not available, use [Fallback Font] as a substitute.

### Image Style and Photography

Images should reflect the diversity of Hong Kong and our customer base. They should be:

- High-quality and professional
- Authentic and relatable, not overly staged
- Reflective of our brand values and personality
- Culturally appropriate and inclusive

Avoid generic stock photos where possible. Instead, invest in custom photography that truly represents our brand and customers.

## Channel-specific Guidelines

Different communication channels require tailored approaches while maintaining overall brand consistency.

### Branch Communications

In-branch communications should be welcoming and informative. Use clear signage, informative posters, and digital displays to guide customers and promote services. Ensure all staff are well-versed in our brand messaging to provide consistent in-person communication.

### Digital Platforms

Our website and mobile app are often the first points of contact for many customers. Ensure they reflect our brand personality through:

- Clean, intuitive design
- Clear, benefit-focused copywriting
- Seamless user experience
- Consistent use of our visual identity elements

### Social Media

On social platforms, we can be more conversational while maintaining professionalism. Post a mix of informative content, financial tips, community engagement, and product information. Respond promptly to comments and messages, always adhering to our brand voice.

### ATM Screens

ATM screens should display clear, concise messages. Use them to promote services or provide helpful information, but keep the primary functions easily accessible.

### Marketing Collateral

Brochures, flyers, and other marketing materials should be visually appealing and information-rich. Use infographics and bullet points to break down complex information. Always include clear calls-to-action.

### Customer Correspondence

Letters, emails, and SMS messages should be personalized where possible. Use a professional yet friendly tone, and always provide clear next steps or contact information for further assistance.

## Customer Experience

Delivering an exceptional customer experience is at the core of our brand promise. Every interaction should reinforce this commitment.

### Key Messaging Points
