## Introduction

This compliance guideline has been developed to provide all employees of [Bank Name] with a comprehensive understanding of their responsibilities in maintaining the highest standards of ethical conduct and regulatory compliance. As a retail bank operating in Hong Kong, we are subject to various laws, regulations, and industry standards that govern our operations. Adherence to these rules is not only a legal requirement but also essential for maintaining the trust of our customers, shareholders, and the broader community.

The purpose of this guideline is to outline the key areas of compliance that each employee must be aware of and adhere to in their daily activities. It is designed to be a practical resource that can be easily referenced and applied in various situations. However, it is important to note that this guideline is not exhaustive, and employees should always seek guidance from their supervisors or the Compliance Department when faced with uncertain situations.

All employees, regardless of their position or tenure, are expected to familiarize themselves with this guideline and apply its principles consistently. Compliance is a shared responsibility, and each of us plays a crucial role in maintaining the integrity and reputation of [Bank Name].

## Regulatory Framework

[Bank Name] operates within a complex regulatory environment governed by various authorities and legislation. It is imperative that all employees understand the key regulatory bodies and laws that impact our operations:

1. Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA): As the primary regulator for banks in Hong Kong, the HKMA issues guidelines and circulars that we must adhere to. These cover areas such as capital adequacy, liquidity, risk management, and corporate governance.

2. Securities and Futures Commission (SFC): For our investment and securities-related activities, we must comply with SFC regulations, including those related to the conduct of regulated activities and the sale of investment products.

3. Anti-Money Laundering and Counter-Terrorist Financing Ordinance (AMLO): This ordinance sets out the legal requirements for financial institutions to prevent money laundering and terrorist financing.

4. Personal Data (Privacy) Ordinance (PDPO): This law governs the collection, use, and handling of personal data in Hong Kong.

5. Hong Kong Association of Banks (HKAB): While not a regulatory body, the HKAB issues guidelines that set industry standards and best practices.

Employees must stay informed about regulatory changes that may affect their areas of responsibility. The Compliance Department will provide regular updates on significant regulatory developments, but all staff are encouraged to proactively seek information and clarification on regulatory matters relevant to their roles.

## Know Your Customer (KYC) and Customer Due Diligence (CDD)

Knowing our customers is fundamental to our ability to serve them effectively and to protect our bank from being used for illicit purposes. All employees involved in customer-facing roles or account management must adhere to the following KYC and CDD principles:

1. Customer Identification: Before establishing a business relationship, we must obtain and verify the identity of the customer. This includes collecting documentary evidence such as identification documents, proof of address, and other relevant information as required by our internal policies.

2. Beneficial Ownership: For corporate customers, we must identify and verify the identity of beneficial owners, i.e., individuals who ultimately own or control the customer.

3. Purpose of Account: We must understand and document the intended purpose and nature of the business relationship.

4. Risk Assessment: Each customer must be assigned a risk rating based on factors such as their background, source of funds, type of business, and geographic location. This risk rating will determine the level of ongoing due diligence required.

5. Ongoing Monitoring: Customer relationships must be continuously monitored to ensure that transactions are consistent with our knowledge of the customer, their business, and risk profile.

6. Enhanced Due Diligence (EDD): For high-risk customers, including Politically Exposed Persons (PEPs), additional measures must be taken to verify their identity, source of wealth, and source of funds.

7. Periodic Review: Customer information must be regularly reviewed and updated to ensure its accuracy and relevance.

Employees must complete all required KYC and CDD procedures before onboarding a new customer or offering additional products or services to existing customers. Any suspicions or concerns about a customer's identity or activities must be reported immediately to the Compliance Department.

## Anti-Money Laundering (AML) and Counter-Terrorist Financing (CTF)

[Bank Name] is committed to preventing the use of its products and services for money laundering or terrorist financing purposes. All employees must be vigilant and adhere to the following AML/CTF principles:

1. Transaction Monitoring: Be alert to unusual or suspicious transactions that may indicate money laundering or terrorist financing activities. This includes large cash transactions, frequent wire transfers to high-risk jurisdictions, or transactions that do not fit the customer's profile.

2. Reporting Suspicious Activities: If you suspect or have reasonable grounds to suspect that a transaction may be related to money laundering or terrorist financing, you must file a Suspicious Transaction Report (STR) with the Compliance Department immediately. Do not tip off the customer about your suspicions or the filing of an STR.

3. Record Keeping: Maintain accurate and complete records of all customer transactions and due diligence information for at least seven years after the end of the business relationship.

4. Training: Attend all mandatory AML/CTF training sessions and stay updated on the latest typologies and red flags.

5. Sanctions Screening: Ensure that all customers and transactions are screened against relevant sanctions lists before processing.

6. Cash and Bearer Instruments: Adhere to the bank's policies on handling large cash transactions and bearer instruments, including proper documentation and reporting.

7. High-Risk Customers and Transactions: Apply enhanced due diligence measures for high-risk customers, products, or transactions, such as those involving PEPs or high-risk jurisdictions.

Remember that AML/CTF compliance is not just a regulatory requirement but a crucial part of our role in protecting the integrity of the financial system. Failure to comply with AML/CTF regulations can result in severe penalties for both the bank and individual employees.
